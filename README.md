# redeemer-deplorables

This repo contains the abuser username list for Redeemer, the script that reaps delegation from faucet-created users.

Redeemer normally reaps *most* of the initial creation delegation (leaving them a small delegation for bandwidth before HF20) - the users in this list have 100% of their delegation removed as they have been deemed unworthy of an SP loan.  They retain their user account and nothing prevents them from posting or powering up their own SP.
